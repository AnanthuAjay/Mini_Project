# Mini_Project

CUSAT as a whole conducts plethora of events like
Hackathons , Seminars , Competitions etc across all the colleges
under the university.
These events are a healthy part of a students academic life as it gains
experience in many areas outside the institutional curriculum.
As the current advertisement of these events are through social medias
And whatsapp groups , it fails to reach the eyes of many eligible
students across the university.
This could be an actual loss of opportunity for eligible students who
are interested in its participation.

# OUR OBJECTIVE

OBJECTIVES
• Have a single web portal to display details of all the events being
conducted in the university.
• Give administrative access to events management groups or
respective authorities (HODs) of that college to manipulate or
update the portal with events conducted by that specific college.
• provide interface for registration of the events
